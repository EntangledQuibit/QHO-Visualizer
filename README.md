# Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Visualizer

## Description
The video to accompany this code can be viewed here:

This is a 3-D visualization tool for the quantum harmonic oscillator developed in Python. I developed this project quickly without much thought to good programatic design, and hence the code is a bit crude and may be difficult to understand. Nevertheless, the visualizations provided are rather pleasing to look at, especially if you understand the underlying physics behind it. If you don't my video provides a very technical explanation for those familiar with the language of quantum mechanics.
